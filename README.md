# Predict-rocket-launch-delays-with-machine-learning
Predict rocket launch delays with machine learning (Learning Path) - Microsoft

## Introduction
\
This learning path introduces you to the world of machine learning. You'll take a real-life problem that NASA faces and apply machine learning to solve it. The goal is to get students excited and curious to discover how machine learning could help solve other problems in space discovery and different aspects of life.

## Business Problem
- To increase the likelihood that the day chosen for launch will be a good weather day.
- To know what conditions should stop a launch..

## Objective
In this module, you'll begin to discover:
- The challenges weather can pose for a rocket launch
- The data science lifecycle
- How machine learning works
- The role ethics play in machine learning

## Methodology
### 1. Data collection
### 2. Data Cleaning
- Filtering the data
- Dealing with missing values
- Using One Hot Encoding to prepare the data to a binary classification
### 3. Build, Train and test the machine learning model to predict rocket launch success
- Building, tuning and evaluation of classification models to ensure the best results
